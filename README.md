# RS-PortfolioPage
A portfolio website for Robert Schmahl that includes an about me page, portfolio page and a contact me form.

portfolio portion of the website currently includes sections for Fireflies, The Scarlet Letter and Photograph 51 poster art. In the future, I'd like to expand upon these sections.

Contact me page currently includes a contact form. In the future this form needs to submit data to a database.
